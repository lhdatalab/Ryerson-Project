# Ryerson-Project
Capstone project -  based on spatiotemporal modelling
### Title:
### What can the people in New York City possibly have in common with those in Scottsdale Arizona?
##### Can spatiotemporal techniques be used to extract local knowledge from global data?

This is for Ryerson University Capstone project. It should involve spatiotemporal modelling. The title has not been finalised.

The event in Ferguson, Missouri on August, 2014 had an extremely polarizing effect globally. This project focuses on tweets from various cities in the USA.

### Problem synopsis:
#### Extracting positive sentiment from geographically diverse populations in space and time– based on a polarizing negative event
#### Topic modelling at the global does not always
  ###### Give high coherent topics
  ###### Reflect any consistent overall sentiment consensus
#### Modelling at the “local” level presents a greater opportunity to extract anomalous positive sentiments
