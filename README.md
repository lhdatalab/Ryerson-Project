# Ryerson-Project
Capstone project -  based on spatiotemporal modelling. See CKME136_Project_PPT.pdf for summary. 
### Title:
### What can the people in New York City possibly have in common with those in Scottsdale Arizona?
##### Can spatiotemporal techniques be used to extract local knowledge from global data?

This is for Ryerson University Capstone project. It involves spatiotemporal modelling. 
The event in Ferguson, Missouri (August, 2014) had an extremely polarizing effect globally. This project focuses on tweets from various cities in the USA.

### Background synopsis:
#### Extracting positive sentiment from geographically diverse populations in space and time – based on a polarizing negative event
#### Topic modelling at the global level does not always
  ###### Give high coherent topics
  ###### Reflect any consistent overall sentiment consensus
#### Modelling at the “local” level presents a greater opportunity to extract anomalous positive sentiments
